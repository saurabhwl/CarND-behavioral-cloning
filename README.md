##Overview
loading data
preprocessing image is the most critical part. in the captured images, there are a lot of background noise, trees and mountains  etc. They are not useful in training. They do create distraction in the model. So it is very important to crop the image to right size to only feed the portion of image that are important for model to learn. Second, data we collected from training track has images with steering on right. It is skew towards the steering towards right. To tackle that, I flip the images so that the data is more balanced. third, we have images from left, right and 

##Approch
The approach taken for deriving and designing a model architecture fit for solving the given problem.

##Preprocessing
Information such as how the dataset was generated and examples of images from the dataset should be included.

##Model architecture
provides sufficient details of the characteristics and qualities of the architecture, such as the type of model used, the number of layers, the size of each layer. Visualizations emphasizing particular qualities of the architecture are encouraged.


##Training dataset 

##Training process
describes how the model was trained and what the characteristics of the dataset are.
